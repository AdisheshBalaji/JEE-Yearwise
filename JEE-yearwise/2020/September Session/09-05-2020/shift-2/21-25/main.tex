\item Let A = \{a,b,c\} and B=\{1,2,3,4\}. Then the number of elements in the set C=\{f : $A \rightarrow B$ $2 \in f\brak{A}$ and f is not one-one\} is :  \hfill{[September 2020]}
 \item The coefficient of $x^4$ in the expansion of $\brak{1+x+x^2+x^3}^6$ in powers of x, is:  \hfill{[September 2020]}
 \item Let the vectors $\Bar{a},\Bar{b},\Bar{c}$ such that $|\Bar{a}|=2,|\Bar{b}|=4$ and $|\Bar{c}|=4$. If the projection of vector b on vector a is \hfill{[September 2020]} equal to the projection of vector c on vector a and b is perpendicular to vector c, then the value $|\Bar{a}+\Bar{b}-\Bar{c}|$ is:
 \item If the lines $x+y=a$ and $x-y=b$ touch the curve $y=x^2-3x+2$ at the points where the curve intersects the x-axis, then a/b is equal to: \hfill{[September 2020]}
 \item In a bombing attack, there is 50\% chance that a bomb will hit the target.At least two independent hits are required to destroy the target completely. Then the minimum number of bombs, that must be dropped to ensure that there is at least 99\% chance of completely destroying the target, is \hfill{[September 2020]}
