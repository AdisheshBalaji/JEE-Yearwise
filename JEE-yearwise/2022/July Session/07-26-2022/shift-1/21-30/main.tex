 \item If for some $p,q,r\in R$,not all have same  sign, one of the roots of the equation $\brak{p^2+q^2}x^2-2q\brak{p+r}x+q^2+r^2=0$ is also a root of the equation $x^2+2x-8=0,$ then $\frac{q^2+r^2}{p^2}$ is equal to\\
    \item The number of $5-$digit natural numbers, such thet the product of their digits is $36,$ is\\
    \item The series of positive multiple of $3$ is divided into sets: $\{3\},\{6,9,12\},\{15,18,21,24,27\},\dots$ Then the sum of the elments in the $11^{th}$ set is equal to\\
