    \item If three successive terms of a G.P. with common ratio $r\brak{r>1}$ are the lengths of the sides of a triangle and $\sbrak{r}$ denotes the greatest integer less than or equal to $r$, then $3\sbrak{r}+\sbrak{-r}$ is equal to:\hfill{Feb 2024}

       

    \item Let $A=I_{2}-2MM^{T}$, where $M$ is a real matrix of order $2\times1$ such that the relation $M^{T}M=I_{1}$ holds. If $\lambda$ is a real number such that the relation $AX=\lambda X$ holds for some non-zero real matrix $X$ of order $2\times1$, then the sum of squares of all possible values of $\lambda$ is equal to:\hfill{Feb 2024}
