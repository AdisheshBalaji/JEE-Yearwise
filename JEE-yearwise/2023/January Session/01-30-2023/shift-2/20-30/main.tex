    \item The 50th root of a number $x$ is 12 and the 50th root of another number $y$ is 18. Then the remainder obtained on dividing $x + y$ by 25 is \rule{2.5cm}{0.4pt}.

    \item Let $A = \{1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 9\}$. Then the number of possible functions $f: A \to A$ such that $f(m \cdot n) = f(m) \cdot f(n)$ for every $m, n \in A$ with $m \cdot n \in A$ is \rule{2.5cm}{0.4pt}.

    \item Let $P(a_1, b_1)$ and $Q(a_2, b_2)$ be two distinct points on a circle with center $C(\sqrt{2}, \sqrt{3})$. Let $O$ be the origin and $OC$ be perpendicular to both $CP$ and $CQ$. If the area of the triangle $OCP$ is $\frac{\sqrt{35}}{2}$, then $a_1^2 + a_2^2 + b_1^2 + b_2^2$ is equal to \rule{2.5cm}{0.4pt}.

    \item Let a line $L$ pass through the point $P(2, 3, 1)$ and be parallel to the line $x + 3y - 2z - 2 = 0 = x - y + 2z$. If the distance of $L$ from the point $(5, 3, 8)$ is $\alpha$, then $3\alpha^2$ is equal to \rule{2.5cm}{0.4pt}.

    \item $\int \sqrt{\sec{2x} - 1} dx = \alpha\log \left| \cos{2x}+\beta+\sqrt{\cos{2x}\brak{1+\cos{\frac{1}{\beta}x}}} \right| + C$, then $\beta - \alpha$ is equal to \rule{2.5cm}{0.4pt}.

    \item If the value of the real number $a > 0$ for which $x^2 - 5ax + 1 = 0$ and $x^2 - ax - 5 = 0$ have a common real root is $\frac{3}{\sqrt{2\beta}}$, then $\beta$ is equal to \rule{2.5cm}{0.4pt}.

    \item A bag contains six balls of different colors. Two balls are drawn in succession with replacement. The probability that both balls are of the same color is $p$. Next, four balls are drawn in succession with replacement, and the probability that exactly three balls are of the same color is $q$. If $p : q = m : n$, where $m$ and $n$ are coprime, then $m + n$ is equal to \rule{2.5cm}{0.4pt}.
