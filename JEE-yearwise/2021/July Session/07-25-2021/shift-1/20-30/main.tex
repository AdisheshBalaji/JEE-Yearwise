    \item Let $a, b$ be two non-zero real numbers. If $p$ and $r$ are the roots of the equation $x^2 - 8ax + 2a = 0$ and $q$ and $s$ are the roots of the equation $x^2 + 12bx + 6b = 0$, such that $\frac{1}{p}, \frac{1}{q}, \frac{1}{r}, \frac{1}{s}$ are in A.P., then $a^{-1} - b^{-1}$ is equal to \rule{2.5cm}{0.4pt}
