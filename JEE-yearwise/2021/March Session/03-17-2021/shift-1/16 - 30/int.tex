\item  Let there be three independent events $E_1$, $E_2$ and $E_3$. The probability that only $E_1$ occurs is $\alpha$, only $E_2$ occurs is $\beta$ and only $E_3$ occurs is $\gamma$. Let $'p'$ denote the probability of none of the events that occur that satisfies the equations $\brak{\alpha - 2\beta}p = \alpha\beta$ and $\brak{\beta - 3\gamma}p = 2\beta\gamma$. All the given probabilities are assumed to lie in the interval \brak{0, 1}. Then, $\frac{\sbrak{\text{probability of occurrence of} E_1}}{\sbrak{\text{probability of occurrence of} E_3}}$ is equal to \_\_\_\_\_\_  \hfill[Mar 2021] \\
