\item $\lim \limits_{x\to 0} \frac{ax-\brak{e^{4x}-1}}{ax\brak{e^{4x}-1}} $\\
 exists and is equal to b, then the value of $a-2b$ is  \hfill{[February 2021]}
 \item A line is a common tangent to the circle $\brak{x-3}^2+y^2=9$ and the parabola $y^2=4x$. If the two points of contact \brak{a,b} and \brak{c,d} are distinct and lie in the first quadrant, then 2\brak{a+c} is equal to  \hfill{[February 2021]}
 \item The value of \\
 $\int_{-2}^{2} |3x^2-3x-6| \, dx$\\
 is  \hfill{[February 2021]}
 \item If the remainder when x is divided by 4 is 3, then the remainder when $\brak{2020+x}^{2022}$ is divided by 8 is \hfill{[February 2021]}

 \item A line L passing through origin is perpendicular to the lines 
 \begin{align*}
     L_1:\vec{r}=\brak{3+t}\hat{i}+\brak{-1+2t}\hat{j}+\brak{4+2t}\hat{k}\\
     L_2:\vec{r}=\brak{3+2s}\hat{i}+\brak{3+2s}\hat{j}+\brak{2+s}\hat{k}
 \end{align*}
 If the co-ordinates of the point in the first octant on $L_2$ at the distance of $\sqrt{17}$ from the point of intersection of L and $L_1$ are \brak{a,b,c}, then 18\brak{a+b+c} is equal to \hfill{[February 2021]}
 \item A function $f$ is defined on \sbrak{-3,3} as\\
 \[
f(x) =

\min\{|x|, 2 - x^2\}, & -2 \leq x \leq 2 \\
\sbrak{|x|}, & 2 < |x| \leq 3 
\end{cases}

where $\sbrak{x}$ denotes the greatest integer $\le$ x. The number of points, where $f$ is not differentiable in $\brak{-3,3}$ is

 \item If the curves $x=y^4$ and $xy=k$ cut at right angles, then $\brak{4k}^6$ is equal to \hfill{[February 2021]}
 \item The total number of two digit numbers 'n', such that $3^n+7^n$ is a multiple of 10, is \hfill{[February 2021]}
 \item $\overset{\rightarrow}{a}\;=\;\hat{i}+\alpha \hat{j}+3\hat{k}$ and $\overset{\rightarrow}{b}\;=\;3\hat{i}-\alpha \hat{j}+\hat{k}$. If the area of the parallelogram whose adjacent sides are represented by the vector $\overset{\rightarrow}{a}$ and $\overset{\rightarrow}{b}$ is $8\sqrt{3}$ square units, then $\overset{\rightarrow}{a}.\overset{\rightarrow}{b}$ is equal to \hfill{[February 2021]}
